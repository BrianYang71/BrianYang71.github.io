# An Introduction to Quantum Computation in Geometric Algebra

Final Project, _Quantum Information and Computation_, 2023 Spring



---

There have been some attempts to express quantum information theory in GA since
1990s. From the single-qubit to multi-particle operations, the GA
approach promises in bringing a more explicit picture to our conception. Although this
research field is still very nascent, some works have appeared in some different areas, such as
entanglement, entropy, no-hiding theorem and quantum
neural networks.
This work sums up several schools of GA notations scattering in different places and
aims to provide new insights on quantum information theory based on the new language of
geometric algebra. We also provide some of the unproven results seen in literature, aiming
for readers to get a full understanding of the computation and ideas.
