# Finite-Blocklength Analysis in the Wiretap Channel

Final Project, _Network Information Theory_, 2024 Spring

---

In the era of Internet of things (IoT), the tradeoff of reliability and security in the finite blocklength
regime emerges as a crucial issue. The wiretap channel is one of the most typical models for characterizing
this tradeoff information-theoretically. This work introduces several security metrics and delivers the core
ideas about how to protect the secret message from the eavesdropper while maintaining the reliability.
Moreover, both the first-order and second-order analysis for the wiretap channel are presented.
We also show an inner bound of the wiretap channel with maximal leakage as the security metric, which
is no larger compared to those secrecy capacity adopting mutual information, total variation secrecy, or
semantic security as the security metric.
