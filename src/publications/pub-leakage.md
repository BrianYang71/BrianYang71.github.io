> In this work, maximal α-leakage is introduced to quantify how much a quantum adversary can learn about any sensitive information of data upon observing its disturbed version via a quantum privacy mechanism. 
We first show that an adversary's maximal expected α-gain using optimal measurement is characterized by measured conditional Rényi entropy.
This can be viewed as a parametric generalization of König _et al._'s famous guessing probability formula [_IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory_, 55(9), 2009](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2025545).
Then, we prove that the α-leakage and maximal α-leakage for a quantum privacy mechanism are determined by measured Arimoto information and measured Rényi capacity, respectively. 
Various properties of maximal α-leakage, such as data processing inequality and composition property are established as well.
Moreover, we show that regularized α-leakage and regularized maximal α-leakage for identical and independent quantum privacy mechanisms coincide with α-tilted sandwiched Rényi information and sandwiched Rényi capacity, respectively.
